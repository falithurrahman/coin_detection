# deteksi_koin

## Description
### In this project, i made a simple program to detect the sum of coin available inside the frame. I used 3 type of coin, 1000, 500 and 100 IDR. This program used OpenCV 3.3 and Visual Studio Community as the editor.
### This project needed constant environment to mantain the detection accuracy of the program i made. So, back then i made a box equipped with LED to make the light and distance from camera to the coin constant. The pictures regarding this project can be seen at the picture folder of this repository.
